## Motivation

Light effect plays an important role in attracting peopleâ€™s attention in many places. Car manufacturers focus on ambient lighting inside the vehicle. Gaming hardware companies include light effects for their computers and keyboards. Even speakers are equipped with lights to attract customers. By utilizing the persistence of vision effect, rotating LEDs can form a 2D display for texts and light patterns. This gadget can be used as a clock, ambient lighting, and many other applications. 

However, visualizing different patterns by rotating LEDs currently requires programmers to take care of every low-level detail when programming on real hardwares. For example, they need to explicitly control the on and off time for every LED light, and there could be thousands of LED lights on one display. So we want to build a persistent vision display library that can help users easily create beautiful patterns with only a few lines of code.
