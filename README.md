# Persistent Vision Display Library

## Introduction

POVLib is a lightweight, customizablem, and easy-to-use persistent vision display library. Programmers can easily integrate this library to their code and create beautiful patterns they want. POVLib also includes a simple html-based web server library to help programmers create a webpage using a few lines of code to interact with the real users of the POV display.

## Motivation

Light effect plays an important role in attracting people’s attention in many places. Car manufacturers focus on ambient lighting inside the vehicle. Gaming hardware companies include light effects for their computers and keyboards. Even speakers are equipped with lights to attract customers. By utilizing the persistence of vision effect, rotating LEDs can form a 2D display for texts and light patterns. This gadget can be used as a clock, ambient lighting, and many other applications. 

However, visualizing different patterns by rotating LEDs currently requires programmers to take care of every low-level detail such as timing and synchronization when programming on real hardwares. For example, they need to explicitly control the on and off time for every LED light, and there could be thousands of LED lights on one display. Programs could be extremely long in such cases. POVLib -- a persistent vision display library can help users easily create beautiful patterns with only a few lines of code.
