# Software Modules

There are two modules in our POVLib project: POV Module and HTML Module. We actually seperate them into two libraries because they can used individually without relying on each other. The POV module is to help programmers create patterns while the HTML module is to help programmers easily build a web server. The HTML module can also be used in many other scenarios.

## POV Module
