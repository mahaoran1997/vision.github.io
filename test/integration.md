# Integration


## 3.1 Download
Our code is open sourced on github: [link](https://github.com/mahaoran1997/PovLib). You can download all library code and example code from github.

## 3.2 Integration to your system

After downloading the code, open Arduino library folder. In that directory, create two folders: Html and POVLib. Copy corresponding source code files to those two folders. Then restart your Arduino IDE. Click Sketch->Include Library->Html and Sketch->Include Library->POVLib (shown as below). Then you can start coding and creating your own patterns now!
